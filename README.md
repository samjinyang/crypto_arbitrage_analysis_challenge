# Crypto Arbitrage Analysis

## *Introduction*

This program runs an analsysis on Bitcoin prices between two exchanges: **Bitstamp** and **Coinbase**.  The 3 major steps taken for this analysis are: **1) collect the data, 2) prepare the data, and 3) analyze the data.**

## Technologies

**Python 3.7.9** was used to code this program, and the code is held in a **Jupyter Notebook** file.  The Python libararies used to make this program possible are: **Pandas, Pathlib, and Matplotlib.**

## Installation Guide

Since this is a **Jupyter Notebook** file, please open **Jupyter Lab** to run this file.

We will the plot the dataframes to help us visualize the data to look for arbitrage opportunities, and making multiple calculations for spread returns and potential profitable trades:
